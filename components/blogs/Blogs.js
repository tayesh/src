                    <h5>Authentication</h5>
                    <p>Authentication verifies who the user is.It works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.
                        That's why we can say it is the first step of a good identity and access management process also it is visible to and partially changeable by the user.</p>

                    <h5>Authorization</h5>
                    <p>On the other hand authorization determines what resources a user can access.It works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.
                        That's the reason authorization always takes place after authentication and authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</p>

                    <p>With Firebase, it's pretty simple to connect and use built-in third-party authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, among others.
                        And if you want to use a pre-built authentication UI, you have it at your disposal as well.</p>
